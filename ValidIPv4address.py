# Surely all of us are familiar with the IPV4 addresses - Internet Protocol version 4. An IPV4 address is represented by four 
# 8
# 8-bit integers, separated by ., for example: 192.168.1.1 or 255.255.255.0. Therefore, a string 

# s is an IPV4 address if it meets the following conditions:

# s consists of four integers with values in the range 
# [
# 0
# ,
# 255
# ]
# [0,255].
# Two integers are separated by a .
# Task: Input a string 
# ï¿½
# ,
# s, check whether it is a valid IPV4 address.
